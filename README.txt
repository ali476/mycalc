# mycalc
A basic calculator

It's like this; apparently someone once asked a dog "why do you lick your own balls?" and the dog replied: "because I can!"

Sometimes it feels like the IT guys in an organisation just do things because they can. For some reason they decided to 
limit MS Store in Windows 10 which means us poor coders can't use things like the calculator or the image viewer that come
as standard with Windows! You may well ask "why"? goto joke (or word of wisdom?) above!

Help yourself if you think it is useful; feel free to make a contribution. Source code is here: https://github.com/ali476/mycalc

All I ask is that if you do use it and find it useful, just remember to say thank you!
